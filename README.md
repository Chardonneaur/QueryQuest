# QueryQuest

QueryQuest is an open-source web application that empowers Matomo users to custom reports based on the Live method API.

## Version 1: Custom reports

The first version of QueryQuest focuses on creating a custom report based on a json sample dataset.

## Future Plans

In future versions of QueryQuest, we plan to add features such as:

- Querying a specific datafeed
- Ask Mistral AI to make recommendations based on the data.

We welcome contributions from the open-source community! If you're interested in contributing to QueryQuest, please review our contributing guidelines and code of conduct.
